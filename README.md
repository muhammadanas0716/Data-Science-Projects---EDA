# Data-Science-Projects EDA
 The projects I've done over the course of time for praticing my EDA and Data Science Skills. You can check the code out and also learn!
 
**1. Heart Data Analysis** ➡️ I simply took a dataset from **Kaggle** and did some EDA on it. Rather basic one but was technical, meaning it had some jargon which took me some time to understand. Otherwise a great datset. Enjoyed exploring it!

**2. Flights Prices - Analysis** ➡️ Another dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhambathwal/flight-price-prediction), all about flight prices. I did a very comprehensive EDA on it. It was fun as I learned many new plots and explored!!

**3. Salary Dataset - Analysis** ➡️ It was an awsome project, truely loved it. It was regading some salaries of devs in India. It was a small dataset, yet you could do so much! Check it out to see what I did!!

**4. Forbes Richest Poeple - Analysis** ➡️ Ahh, didn't go so well - actually got bored. The project still isn't complete. If you find it interesting, feel free to comeplete the project. I'd love the contibution!!

**5. Netflix TV Shows and Movies - Analysis** ➡️ My favourite most project ever. I did this as a part of Certification by [Jovain](https://jovian.ai/learn/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas). I learned a lot from it, like A LOT. I used many plots, purely from matplotlib. It was really a decent project, which took me around 3 days to complete but totally worth it!

**6. Tradyflow - Analysis** ➡️ This dataset was obtained from [tradytics.com](https://tradytics.com/trady-flow) on the date **21st June 2022**. It could be possible by the time you get the code, you might not find the dataset on the website **tradytics.com** except for this Github repo. This project was very fun to do. This was the first project in which I used pandas a lot. From basic manipulation to detailed and deep filtering. It took me a few days but was totally worth it. Loved and totally enjoyed it.

Am always open to pull requests and contributions. I'll surely add them in the project! Fork it and feel free to add whatever you want, even if it is a basic 2-D Bar graph 🤝🏻
